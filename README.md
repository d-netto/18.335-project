# Monte-Carlo Integration via Adaptive Importance Sampling

Final project for 18.335 (Numerical Methods, Spring 2020) on Monte-Carlo Integrators with Adaptive Importance Sampling. Implementations from https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00949659208810398 and https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4845 can be found on `ais_methods.jl`. 

Results can be reproduced by instantiating the environment defined by `Manifest.toml` and `Project.toml` and running `ais_methods.jl`. Comparisons with https://github.com/JuliaMath/HCubature.jl are discussed in the write-up.
