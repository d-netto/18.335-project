# 18.335-project
Final project for 18.335 (Numerical Methods) on Monte-Carlo Integrators with Adaptive Importance Sampling, taken during Spring 2020. Implementations based on https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4845 and https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00949659208810398 can be found on /src. Comparisons with https://github.com/JuliaMath/HCubature.jl are also presented in the paper.
