# Monte-Carlo Integration via Adaptive Importance Sampling

Final project for 18.335 (Numerical Methods) on Monte-Carlo Integrators with Adaptive Importance Sampling. Implementations from https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00949659208810398 and https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4845 can be found on `ais_methods.jl`. 

Results can be reproduced by activating/instantiating the environment defined by `Manifest.toml` and `Project.toml` and running `ais_methods.jl`.

All benchmarks in `ais_writeup.pdf` were run on a 1.8 GHz Intel Core i5 machine with 8 GB 1600 MHz memory running macOS High Sierra 10.13.6.
