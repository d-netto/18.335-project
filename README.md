Final project for 18.335 (Numerical Methods, Spring 2020) on Monte-Carlo Integrators with Adaptive Importance Sampling. Implementations based on the papers https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00949659208810398 and https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4845 can be found on /src. 

Results can be reproduced by running run_tests.jl and omparisons with https://github.com/JuliaMath/HCubature.jl are discussed presented in the write-up.
